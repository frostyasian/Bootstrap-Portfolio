            <p class="body">My name is Zuoyi and I love to rock climb. I found climbing on May 30th, 2018 from a friend who was a on and off climber. She showed me climbing and I immediately fell in love with the sport. It proved a challenge not only physically but also mentally. I like to see the routes as individual problems that can be solved in multiple ways. There is no right way or wrong way to climb a route but there are ways that are easier than others depending on your height, strength, and flexibility.</p>

            <p class="body">Climbing has become an outlet for me to relieve stress as well as have fun. It has made me venture into uncomfortable situations that I had to learn to overcome. I think climbing has taught me a lot of patience and if you put in the work, you will get results whether how small those results may be. I think thats why I'm so attached to climbing, that and all the friends and family I have created because of the wonderful community. I would reccomend anyone to try climbing becuase you wouldn't know if you like it until you are already hooked.</p>
